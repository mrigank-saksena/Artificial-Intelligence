## **Background**
This is an intelligent game-playing AI to play a human in Othello.
The user can specify a time limit for each AI move.
The AI utilizes alpha-beta pruning, A* searching, and modified heuristics.
The AI can also play itself and the user can import a previous unfinished game.

**_The AI will most probably beat you because it's an AI and you're not._**
